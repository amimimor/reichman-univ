# Software Architecture

## Wikipedia 
* "Software architecture refers to the fundamental <span style="color:blue;">structures</span> of a software <span style="color:blue;">system</span> and the <span style="color:purple;">discipline</span> of creating such structures and systems." 
* "Each <span style="color:blue;">structure</span> comprises software <span style="color:red;"> elements</span>, <span style="color:red;"> relations </span> among them, and <span style="color:purple;">properties</span> of both elements and relations."

* system:
    * structures: 
        * element <-- relation --> element

# Software Architecture
## Static Analysis of a System

* "Software architecture is about making fundamental structural choices that are <span style="color:red;">costly to change once implemented</span>" (wikipedia, this time getting it right)
* What's costly to change (over time):
    * Programming Language (changing/adding mostly breaks common tools) --> "element"
    * <span style="color:blue">Data Model</span> (breaks everything if done wrong) --> "property of an element"
    * Runtime Environment (on-prem vs cloud x/y/z) --> "structure+system"
    * Contracts (APIs) --> "relations"

# Software Architecture

## System Design
* "Fighting" the windmills of **complexity** as software obeys the 2nd law of thermodynamics (complexity never decreases) ![bg right:40% 80%](complexity.webp)

* But what is complex? ("This part of the codebase doesnâ€™t *feel* right!")
* When do you surrender to the evil called "management"?
* The humanity! (You care about people not losing their minds)

# Software Architecture
## Evaluation

Also know as **reviewing things**:
* High Level Design Review - system
* Code Reviews - quality
* Security Reviews - security safety
* Test Review - code safety
* Data Modeling Review - correct abstraction/database performance
* DevOps Review - environment/deployment
* SRE Review - gauges

Long Story Short - Make sure stuff alines with your company *vision* on how software is being made

# Software Architecture
## Evolution
* Fun/easy stuff is to do *NEW* things
* NotSoFun/hardest stuff is to evolve *OLD* things
* Read about: "evolutionary architecture"
